				<strong>Dear neighbor,</strong></p><p></p><p>My name is Michael Bartlett, head instructor of our martial arts school here in Cookeville. For some time now, we've dedicated our lives to bringing the physical - and spiritual - benefits of martial arts to our community.</p><p></p><p>Through classes geared for men and women of all ages, shapes and sizes, our school itself has become a community of learning and growth.</p><p></p><p>We'd love nothing more than for you to become a part of it. That way you too can enrich your life, learn self-defense, and get in great shape too.</p><p></p><p>Together, these three elements lead to a happier, healthier life.</p><p></p><p>After all, for thousands of years, martial arts has been a tool for inner-growth and development. The hard work and patience required to perfect each move builds discipline, focus and determination.</p><p></p><p>The desire to advance through the ranks develops goal setting and ambition. The rush of passing tests, and seeing how far you've come builds confidence and pride.</p><p></p><p>And the increased energy that comes with getting in good physical shape gives you a boost to bring even more fulfilling activities into your life.   But it doesn't stop there. You also learn self-defense to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and sound. And while you may never have to use these skills in a real-life situation - just knowing that you CAN protect yourself will give you peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the confidence you'll exude is enough to diffuse most situations before they ever arise. After all, attackers like to focus in on weak individuals. When you emit strength, confidence and pride - it's enough to keep most of them at bay.</p><p></p><p>Helping you succeed in martial arts is the only goal of our Cookeville program. Everyone here - each of our martial arts instructors - is passionate about helping you succeed, have fun, and enjoy the time you spend here.</p><p></p><p>So come on by and try out the program that's best-suited for you. You can learn more about the classes our Cookeville school offers, and call us to register for the one that's right for you.</p><p></p><p>See you soon, </p><p>Michael Bartlett</p><p></p><p>Head instructor, Upper Cumberland MMA	 </p><p>Cookeville Martial Arts			</div>

    						<p>Get in the best shape of your life as you learn what just might be the most complete fighting system on the planet.

You'll probably bulk up a bit too as your body becomes more &amp; more packed with muscle. If you're into adrenaline rushes, this is the program for you. </p><p> </p><p></p>
